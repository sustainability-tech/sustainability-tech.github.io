      <p>The “Internet of Things” comprises a suite of rapidly growing technologies. It is made up of billions of “smart” devices — from minuscule chips to gigantic machines — that use wireless technology to talk to each other. Our IoT world is growing at a breathtaking pace, with a projected <em>200 billion devices expected to be in operation by 2020</em>.</p>

<p><span class="image image-text right"><img src="/images/smartcity.jpg" alt="Smart city" /> <em>Figure 1:</em> IoT solutions for Smart Cities</span></p>
<h3 id="iot-applications">IoT Applications</h3>
<p>Currently a large number of different IoT devices are being deployed around the world to tackle a plethora of disparate problems. The majority of these sensors are being deployed in urban areas. They are turning our cities in so called “Smart cities” with the technology already beginning to impact us in everyday live.</p>

<h3 id="smart-landscapes">Smart Landscapes</h3>
<p>Sectors outside of urban development and industry are lagging behind in the implementation of smart solutions. Sustainability Tech is changing this by applying smart technologies across a variety of different areas. We are providing solutions that turn valuable multi-functional landscapes comprising of forests, agriculture, peatlands and water into Smart Landscapes. With our extensive knowledge and experience in these sectors and through the use of cutting edge technology.</p>

<h3 id="connection-remote-locations">Connection remote locations</h3>
<p>Sustainability Tech uses LoRa as prefered method of wireless communication. LoRa is a wireless technology much like WiFi and GSM/4G. In contrast to these more well known wireless communication systems LoRa has some key advantages and features:</p>

<h5 id="long-range">Long range</h5>
<p>Single base station provides deep penetration in dense urban/indoor regions, plus connects rural areas up to 40 km away, which is important for approaching solutions in rural and forested landscapes</p>

<h5 id="low-costs">Low costs</h5>
<p>Three way cost reduction: reduced infrastructure investment, lower operating costs and end-node sensors</p>

<h5 id="standardized">Standardized</h5>
<p>Improved global interoperability speeds adoption and roll out of LoRaWAN-based networks and IoT applications</p>

<h5 id="low-power">Low power</h5>
<p>Protocol designed specifically for low power consumption extending battery lifetime up to 5 years</p>

<h5 id="high-capacity">High capacity</h5>
<p>Supports millions of messages per base station, ideal for public network operators serving many customers</p>

<h5 id="secure">Secure</h5>
<p>Embedded end-to-end AES128 encryption</p>

<h5 id="no-data-subscriptions">No data subscriptions</h5>
<p>A wireless protocol that does not need any data subscription like GSM/LTE</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Sustainability Tech has an in-house R&amp;D department that develops custom solutions for our clients. We develop specific Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for any type of project that has sustainability as its motivator. For example watertable measurements in peatland and noise detection in tropical forests against illegal deforestation. These sensors are connected via RS-485 to our LoRa nodes that in turn send the data back to our LoRa gateways. This makes it possible to have 24/7 connectivity in the most demanding areas.</p>

<h3 id="the-dashboard">The dashboard</h3>
<p>To make sure that you have the best experience in working with the collected data from the field we build a dashboard that gives you realtime insights in your measurements. Set your custom notifications to receive updates when certain criteria are met. Broadcast them on Facebook, Twitter, email or even SMS. Futhermore we have a fine grained solution for user management. Let the right people see and handle the data they should handle.</p>

<h3 id="third-party-integration">Third party integration</h3>
<p>Have your own system that needs to be connected to your sensors? Let us know what you are looking for, our developers can connect our system which most API’s.</p>
