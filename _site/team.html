  <h2>Sebastian Persch</h2>
  <p>Co-founder</p>
</header>
<p>Sebastian strongly believes that recent technological advances need to be and should be made available for sustainability practitioners —in particular smallholder farmers— in order to make the entry into sustainable certification easier, more transparent and less costly. Without technological innovation in these areas, truly sustainable tropical landscapes will remain out of reach.</p>

<p>With over 7 years of research experience in tropical peatlands, oil palm production, climate change mitigation as well, consulting on advanced data analysis and statistical programming for forest conservation projects across Southeast Asia, Sebastian understands the complexity of tropical landscapes and thus sees the need for improvement of smallholder certification schemes across agricultural commodities.</p>

  <h2>Josh van Vianan</h2>
  <p>Co-founder</p>
</header>
<p>Josh strongly believes in the potential of technological solutions to engender equitable, transparent and sustainable landscapes. Through providing simple and knowledge driven applications, better engaged stakeholder communities can be empowered to contribute towards higher sustainability standards and certifications for the benefit of both local people and the environment.</p>

<p>With an academic background in ecology and biodiversity conservation, and more recent academic pursuits researching integrated landscape approaches in the tropics, Josh brings with him a unique set of skills, ideas and experiences required to build integrated and multi-faceted systems for making positive change in complex forested landscapes of global social and ecological importance.</p>

  <h2>Roy Niels 1</h2>
  <p>Co-founder</p>
</header>
<p>Roy strongly believes that there are still great steps to be made in bringing technological solutions to the field of sustainability. Where companies working in these fields might not always have the technical know how to streamline these processes, he thinks that Sustainability Tech can make a significant difference and raise the field of sustainability to a new level.</p>

<p>With a 15 years working experience programming mainly web applications, he knows what it takes to automate complex systems. He has worked for renowned clients all around the globe and has been leading projects that not only expected the technical knowledge but also creative solutions where time constraints were high. He is fluent in a multitude of programming languages and is always looking for technical solutions to optimise products, being it software based or hardware oriented.</p>

<p>Isti has over 12 years’ of experience in regulatory design and implementation for state asset management in Indonesia with specialization in sustainable financing and environmental policy. Her areas of focus include sustainable natural resources management and conservation, institutional development, policies, and financing, public sector strategy and community engagement.</p>

<p>Before joining Sustainability Tech, Isti worked for Indonesian Ministry of Finance and was a certified government’s non-attorney representative at court and a public bailiff.</p>

  <h2>Made Weda Maharta</h2>
  <p>Hardware/software developer</p>
</header>
<p>As part of his internship for the Bali State Polytechnic Weda has joined Sustainability Tech to help with current hardware and work on new cutting edge IoT devices that will be the new generation of field devices that collect real time data.</p>

<p>Weda is building (prototype) hardware and programming in low level programming languages like C and C++ to make sure our sensors give back the most accurate results.</p>
