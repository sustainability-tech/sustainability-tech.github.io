## Smart landscapes

The “Internet of Things” comprises a suite of rapidly growing technologies. It is made up of billions of “smart” devices — from minuscule chips to gigantic machines — that use wireless technology to talk to each other. Our IoT world is growing at a breathtaking pace, with a projected _200 billion devices expected to be in operation by 2020_.

#### IoT Applications
Currently a large number of different IoT devices are being deployed around the world to tackle a plethora of disparate problems. The majority of these sensors are being deployed in urban areas. They are turning our cities in so called “Smart cities” with the technology already beginning to impact us in everyday live.

#### Smart Landscapes
Sectors outside of urban development and industry are lagging behind in the implementation of smart solutions. Sustainability Tech is changing this by applying smart technologies across a variety of different areas. We are providing solutions that turn valuable multi-functional landscapes comprising of forests, agriculture, peatlands and water into Smart Landscapes. With our extensive knowledge and experience in these sectors and through the use of cutting edge technology.

#### How it works
Sustainability Tech uses LoRa as prefered method of wireless communication. LoRa is a wireless technology much like WiFi and GSM/4G. In contrast to these more well known wireless communication systems LoRa has some key advantages and features:

##### Long range
Single base station provides deep penetration in dense urban/indoor regions, plus connects rural areas up to 40 km away, which is important for approaching solutions in rural and forested landscapes

##### Low costs
Three way cost reduction: reduced infrastructure investment, lower operating costs and end-node sensors

##### Standardized
Improved global interoperability speeds adoption and roll out of LoRaWAN-based networks and IoT applications

##### Low power
Protocol designed specifically for low power consumption extending battery lifetime up to 5 years

##### High capacity
Supports millions of messages per base station, ideal for public network operators serving many customers

##### Secure
Embedded end-to-end AES128 encryption

##### No data subscriptions
A wireless protocol that does not need any data subscription like GSM/4G
